# Movie-explorer

This is a Movie explorer where you can search by title and genre filtering feature is also provided
As Omdb API doesn't supports search by GENRE that's why it is not working right now but i have implemented the logic of genre filtering
here you can search movies and by clicking on tehm you can find all the information regarding that movie.
I have implemented an aditional feature of adding movies to your watchlist by clicking on a heart button,
This feature is a must for any movie explorer, In future i can implement auithentication in  this so that the watchlist will be saved in database for each user
